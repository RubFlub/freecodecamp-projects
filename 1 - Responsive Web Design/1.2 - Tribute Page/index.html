                <li><span class="date">1913</span> - Works on his new theory of gravity.</li>
                <li><span class="date">1914</span> - Becomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin. Maric and the children move there in April, but they return to Zurich after three months. Divorce proceedings begin. In August, World War I begins.</li>
